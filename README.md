# Subway-Learner
RL learner for the popular Subway Surfer game

## Set-Up for the Learner ##
While you are free to use any mirror that enables you to play Subway Surfer on a phone-dimension
with mouse clickable controls we recommend using the bluestacks android emulator due to its low
latency. It is imperative that your solution is also low-latency as the learner is not trained in 
a high noise environment.

## Rules for Running the Learner ##
1. The screen is behind a monotonic light colour background.
2. The window is the only one with similar size and dimension on the screen.
3. The game is in the initial homepage, NOT the restart page.
